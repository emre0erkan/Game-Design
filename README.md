# Game-Design
I am interested in creative side of game making.

I have never had an education for preparing game design documents, drawing or any visual arts. And I don't have the equipment to create professional drawings.
I am going to be drawing on paper and put pictures of them in documents for now.

New design documents are going to be added soon.

Currently preparing English versions of the documents.
