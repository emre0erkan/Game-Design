# Game-Design
I am interested in creative side of game making.

I have never had an education for drawing, any visual arts or preparing game design document. And I don't have the equipment to create professional drawings.
I am going to be drawing on paper and put pictures of them in documents for now.

New design documents are going to be added soon.
